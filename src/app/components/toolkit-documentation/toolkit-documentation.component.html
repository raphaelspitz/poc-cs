    <h3>
        Welcome to Toolkit IWM
    </h3>

    <p>
        The goal of this project is to standardize a UI library reusable in terms of components and sass.
    </p>

    <p>
        We are creating this library to avoid using too many external libraries and problems of accessibility in case if
        it is needed to be used with a custom specific design asked to developed on our project.
    </p>
    <p>
        Also, we are centralizing the css to match with the design guidelines so that it has a close naming convention
        associated to it and to prevent using inline css. Therefore we will be able to reduce the amount of css.
    </p>
    <p>
        This project is a separate project created under the IWM folder, we did it to avoid creating conflicts with the
        existing one, however we have created modules that can be added inside the project and it works.
    </p>
    <p>
        The purpose is too only standardize the code and to only add components that has be customized if it is not
        available in out of the box widgets or if it doesn't match with the requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
        And as last purpose it will give the possibility to create knowledge sharing with documentations available
        between developers and other participants. This project is available on git and can be run with npm run
        proxy-demo on port 4202.
    </p>
    <p>
        Every devs can create pull request on it if needed and participate :)

        icons are available as well
    </p>
    <p>
        borders, backgrounds, hover effects transitions are presents with css naming conventions that matches on design
        guidelines for examples : border-bottom-gray-3, bg-gray-2, bg-gray-1, hover-bg-gray-1
    </p>
    <p>

    <h3>
        What is available already
    </h3>

    <p>
        In this section we have inserted some components already available but to see all the examples you can click on
        the nav bar on top, we have divided the components per sections.
    </p>
    <p>
        We have already put in place in the button section the code to copy paste if a developer needs to instanciate a
        new button. We will add the same logic in all the sections soon.
    </p>
    <p>
        To access the code just click on the button show hide code on the section associated to it.
